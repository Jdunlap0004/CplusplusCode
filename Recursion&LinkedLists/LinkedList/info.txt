Instructions: print make and test_program to the terminal to 
begin the program. Once it begins, each test will run itself, the user
will just have to press enter to continue onto the next test.
Limitations: It lacks error handling such as printing error messages if 
an incorrect value is inputted into the list.

Complexity Analysis: The sorting functions optimize merge sort algorithms.
This includes splitting the list, sorting it, and merging it back together.
The big O runtime complexity is O(nlog(n)) which applies to both ascending 
and descending.
